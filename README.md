R [sparklyr](https://sparklyr.ai/) extension for using [John Snow Labs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/) 
[Spark NLP](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/spark-nlp) library.

# Installation
Install from this Github repository using:

```
remotes::install_github("r-spark/sparknlp")
```

# Usage
There are a lot of examples in R notebooks inside the `examples` directory. I recommended starting with the 
notebooks in [tutorials/certification_trainings](https://github.com/r-spark/sparknlp/tree/master/examples/tutorials/certification_trainings).

The `examples` directory structure here follows the notebook examples found at
[spark-nlp-workshop](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop).
Note that not all the Jupyter notebooks found there have been ported yet, but all functionality still exists in the 
package.
